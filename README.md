<h1>GuSi-Radio</h1> 

Reduced to the essentials – open to everything.

GuSi (“<b>Gu</b>tes <b>Si</b>gnal”) is an Internet radio that specifically avoids unnecessary complexity. 
No complicated menus – just switch on and listen. Ideal for seniors, children and purists.

<h3>You can find all information about the function and DIY instructions on <a href="https://gusi-radio.de/en/home-english/">www.gusi-radio.de</a>.</h3>
